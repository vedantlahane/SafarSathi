## SECTION 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What Is YatraX

YatraX (Yatra = Journey in Sanskrit + X = Next-gen) is a mobile-first Progressive Web App that provides real-time AI-powered safety intelligence to tourists. It continuously analyzes the tourist's surroundings using 153 factors across 16 categories and provides proactive alerts BEFORE danger occurs — not just reactive warnings.

The app's entire visual identity — colors, animation speeds, glow intensities — shifts dynamically based on the current ML-calculated safety score, making the interface itself a safety indicator. The app feels alive and responsive to the environment.

**Target region**: Assam, India (expandable to other Indian states, then global)
**Target users**: Domestic and international tourists, solo travelers, female travelers, elderly tourists, adventure travelers in remote/wilderness areas
**Platform**: Progressive Web App — installable, works offline, feels native
**Status**: In active development, refactoring from MVP to production architecture

## SECTION 2: COMPLETE TECH STACK

### Frontend Core
- React 19 with concurrent features
- TypeScript 5.7 in strict mode
- Vite 6 as bundler with HMR

### Styling and UI
- Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS-first configuration using @theme block
## SECTION 3: TECH STACK

### Frontend (Tourist Native App Experience)
- **Framework:** React 19 (concurrent transitions) + TypeScript 5.7 (strict)
- **Vite 6 Frontend Tooling:** HMR, optimized builds
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (@theme block, no legacy config file)
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui + custom glassmorphism components
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Mapping:** React-Leaflet 4.2.1 + Leaflet 1.9.4
- **State:** React Context API (Session, Theme, SOS) + localStorage caching
- **Offline:** Service Worker + IndexedDB (future map tile cache)

### Backend (Currently Separate Node Repository)
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js (REST API + Controllers + Middleware)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **ORM:** Mongoose (Schemas, geospatial queries)
- **Real-time:** WebSocket Server (simple `ws` implementation)
- **Security:** Standard CORS, Express JSON parser

### Google Maps Platform (Data Only, No Rendering)
Critical architectural decision: Google provides DATA, Leaflet provides MAP RENDERING. We never load the Google Maps JavaScript API for tile rendering.

APIs used:
- Places API (New) — search autocomplete, place details, nearby search, place photos
- Directions API — route calculation with alternatives, polyline decoding
- Distance Matrix API — real travel time to police stations and hospitals
- Geocoding API — reverse geocode for SOS address context and location labels
- Air Quality API — AQI data as safety score factor
- Geolocation API — WiFi-based positioning fallback when GPS fails

Estimated cost: $400-600/month for 1000 active users without caching, $100-150/month with aggressive caching

### Environment Variables
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL        — Backend API base URL
VITE_WS_URL              — WebSocket endpoint
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY — Google Maps Platform key
VITE_ENABLE_GOOGLE_PLACES          — Feature flag (boolean)
VITE_ENABLE_GOOGLE_DIRECTIONS      — Feature flag
VITE_ENABLE_GOOGLE_GEOCODING       — Feature flag
VITE_ENABLE_GOOGLE_DISTANCE_MATRIX — Feature flag
VITE_ENABLE_GOOGLE_AIR_QUALITY     — Feature flag
VITE_APP_VERSION                   — Semantic version string
```

When Google feature flags are disabled, the app falls back to: Nominatim for search, straight-line distance for routing, no AQI data.

## SECTION 3: DESIGN SYSTEM — "Glassmorphism Safety"

### Visual Philosophy

"Premium frosted-glass aesthetic that breathes with the environment."

The app does not just display safety data — it BECOMES the safety state. The entire color palette, animation speed, glow intensity, and SOS ball size shifts based on the ML safety score. Every glass card, every button, every badge reflects the current safety context.

### Core Design Principles
1. Glassmorphism First — every overlay uses frosted-glass effect
2. Dynamic Theming — entire palette shifts with safety score
3. Smooth Transitions — 2-second color interpolations in oklch color space
4. Mobile-Native Feel — active states over hover, 44px minimum touch targets
5. Accessibility Always — color is never the only indicator, aria-labels everywhere
6. Dark Mode Responsive — auto-switches at 6 PM and 6 AM, user-overrideable

---

## SECTION 4: DYNAMIC COLOR SYSTEM

The safety score (0-100) drives three distinct theme states. Every 30 seconds or on significant location change, the backend calculates a new score and the entire app transitions smoothly.

### Theme State: SAFE (Score 80-100)
Emotion: Calm, peaceful, reassuring

CSS Variables:
- --theme-bg-from: oklch(0.97 0.03 160) — soft emerald wash
- --theme-bg-to: oklch(0.97 0.02 180) — cyan tint
- --theme-primary: oklch(0.65 0.17 160) — emerald-500 base
- --theme-primary-foreground: oklch(0.99 0 0)
- --theme-glow: oklch(0.65 0.17 160 / 0.15) — subtle emerald glow
- --theme-card-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.70)
- --theme-card-border: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.15)
- --sos-scale: 1
- --sos-pulse-speed: 3s — slow calm pulse

Visual appearance: Background has gentle emerald gradient barely perceptible. Glass cards have emerald-tinted borders. SOS ball is 48px pulsing slowly. Status badge reads "Low Risk" in emerald. All interactive elements use emerald accent.

### Theme State: CAUTION (Score 50-79)
Emotion: Alert, attentive, watchful

CSS Variables:
- --theme-bg-from: oklch(0.97 0.03 85) — warm amber wash
- --theme-bg-to: oklch(0.97 0.02 95) — yellow tint
- --theme-primary: oklch(0.68 0.15 85) — amber-500 base
- --theme-primary-foreground: oklch(0.99 0 0)
- --theme-glow: oklch(0.68 0.15 85 / 0.15) — amber glow
- --theme-card-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.70)
- --theme-card-border: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.15)
- --sos-scale: 1.17
- --sos-pulse-speed: 2s — medium pulse

Visual appearance: Background shifts to warm amber gradient. Glass cards have amber-tinted borders. SOS ball grows to 56px and pulses faster. Status badge reads "Moderate Risk" in amber. Transition from previous state is smooth 2-second fade.

### Theme State: DANGER (Score 0-49)
Emotion: Urgent, alarming, protective

CSS Variables:
- --theme-bg-from: oklch(0.97 0.03 25) — urgent red wash
- --theme-bg-to: oklch(0.97 0.02 35) — orange-red tint
- --theme-primary: oklch(0.62 0.23 25) — red-500 base
- --theme-primary-foreground: oklch(0.99 0 0)
- --theme-glow: oklch(0.62 0.23 25 / 0.20) — intense red glow at 20%
- --theme-card-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75) — slightly more opaque
- --theme-card-border: rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.20)
- --sos-scale: 1.33
- --sos-pulse-speed: 1s — aggressive rapid pulse

Visual appearance: Background has urgent red gradient more noticeable than other states. Glass cards have red-tinted borders with stronger glow. SOS ball grows to 64px pulsing rapidly. Status badge reads "High Risk" in red with alert icon. Digital ID card border glows red subtly. Map risk zones appear more prominent.

### Theme Transition Mechanics

All animatable CSS custom properties are registered with @property declarations so browsers can interpolate them smoothly:

```
@property --theme-primary {
  syntax: '<color>';
  initial-value: oklch(0.65 0.17 160);
  inherits: true;
}
```

The :root element uses SPECIFIC property transitions (NOT "transition: all 2s" which destroys performance):

```
:root {
  transition-property: --theme-primary, --theme-bg-from, --theme-bg-to,
                       --theme-glow, --theme-card-border, --sos-scale;
  transition-duration: 2s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}
```

Why oklch color space: perceptually uniform (humans perceive transitions as smooth), wide gamut (richer colors than RGB/HSL), predictable interpolation (no unexpected hue shifts during transition), modern browser support above 90% with graceful degradation.

The ThemeProvider updates BOTH our custom --theme-* variables AND shadcn's --color-primary (converted to HSL) simultaneously so that all shadcn components (buttons, badges, inputs, switches) shift color together with the theme.

---

## SECTION 5: GLASS CARD HIERARCHY

Three levels of glassmorphism with precise opacity and blur values. Higher levels are more prominent.

### Level 1: Hero Cards (Highest Prominence)
Used for: Safety score hero card, digital ID card front

- background: var(--theme-card-bg) at 70% opacity white
- backdrop-filter: blur(20px)
- border: 1px solid var(--theme-card-border)
- box-shadow: 0 8px 32px var(--theme-glow), 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)
- border-radius: 24px (rounded-3xl)
- Dark mode: bg rgba(30,41,59,0.70) with white/5 border, glow shadow intensified

### Level 2: Action Cards (Medium Prominence)
Used for: Quick action buttons, alert list items, destination bar, search results

- background: rgba(255,255,255,0.50)
- backdrop-filter: blur(16px)
- border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.04)
- box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.03)
- border-radius: 16px (rounded-2xl)
- Dark mode: bg rgba(30,41,59,0.50) with white/4 border

### Level 3: Info Cards (Lowest Prominence)
Used for: Daily tip, settings sections, bottom sheet content

- background: rgba(255,255,255,0.30)
- backdrop-filter: blur(12px)
- border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.02)
- box-shadow: none
- border-radius: 12px (rounded-xl)
- Dark mode: bg rgba(30,41,59,0.30) with white/3 border

### Glass on Glass Rule
When nesting glass cards, child uses the next level down. Level 1 hero containing Level 2 actions. Never same level inside same level (causes visual muddiness).

---

## SECTION 6: GRADIENT MESH BACKGROUND

Fixed full-screen layer behind all content providing a dynamic animated background that reinforces theme state without being distracting.

Structure: 3-4 radial gradients using theme color variables, animated with a slow 60-second CSS animation loop. Pure CSS, no JavaScript animation frames, GPU-accelerated.

Light mode opacity: 0.4
Dark mode opacity: 0.15 (much subtler)

In safe theme: gentle emerald orbs drifting slowly
In caution theme: warm amber orbs with slightly more energy
In danger theme: urgent red orbs with heightened presence

Transition: 2-second smooth fade when theme changes (driven by the CSS variable transitions)

Reduced motion: animation disabled, static at 20% opacity

---

## SECTION 7: TYPOGRAPHY SCALE

Constrained type scale optimized for mobile-first readability:

- text-4xl (36px): Safety score number only
- text-3xl (30px): Page titles
- text-2xl (24px): Section headers
- text-xl (20px): Card titles
- text-lg (18px): Prominent labels, user name in header
- text-base (16px): Default body text
- text-sm (14px): Secondary text, labels, button text
- text-xs (12px): Tertiary text, captions, timestamps
- text-[10px]: Micro labels, badge text, tab labels
- text-[9px]: Smallest text (legend items, fine print)

Font stack: system fonts (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif)

Font weights: bold (700) for score and card titles, semibold (600) for section headers, medium (500) for buttons and badges, normal (400) for body text

Line heights: 1.1 for display (large numbers), 1.2 for headings, 1.5 for body, 1.4 for UI elements

---

## SECTION 8: SPACING AND LAYOUT

Safe area support: padding-top env(safe-area-inset-top) on StatusBar, padding-bottom env(safe-area-inset-bottom) on BottomNav and floating elements

Page container padding: 16px horizontal, top includes safe-area, bottom includes 80px for tab nav plus safe-area

Card spacing: space-y-4 (16px) between cards on home, space-y-6 (24px) between sections, gap-3 (12px) inside cards, gap-2 (8px) for tight groups like badges

Touch targets: minimum 44px by 44px everywhere, no exceptions. Buttons, links, interactive areas all meet this requirement.

---

## SECTION 9: ANIMATION SYSTEM

### Philosophy
Purposeful not decorative. Fast (200-400ms) for UI interactions. Slow (1-2s) for theme transitions. Smooth with appropriate easing. Skippable via prefers-reduced-motion.

### Core Animations

1. Theme Transition: 2000ms ease-in-out on :root CSS variables. Long enough to notice, short enough not to annoy. Feels organic.

2. Safety Score Morph: requestAnimationFrame-based smooth counting animation, NOT stepping. Duration 800ms, easeOutCubic easing (starts fast, ends slow — feels natural for numbers). Animates from previous score to new score.

3. Card Entrance: Staggered slide-in-up animation. Each child delayed by 60ms (child 1 at 0ms, child 2 at 60ms, child 3 at 120ms, up to 8 children). Each animation: 400ms ease-out, translateY(12px) to translateY(0) with opacity 0 to 1.

4. SOS Ball Pulse: Keyframe animation with speed tied to theme. Box-shadow expands from 0 to 12px then fades. Safe: 3s, Caution: 2s, Danger: 1s.

5. Countdown Pop: 400ms ease-out. Scale from 0.3 to 1.15 (overshoot) to 1.0, with opacity 0 to 1. Used for 3-2-1 countdown numbers.

6. Touch Feedback: 100ms ease-out, scale(0.97) plus opacity 0.9 on :active state. Applied to all interactive elements via .touch-action class. -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent.

7. Gradient Mesh Drift: 60-second loop, 4 blobs drifting with scale variations. Pure CSS keyframes.

8. Directional Bounce: 1s infinite ease-in-out. Four variants (left, right, up, down) each bouncing 8px in their direction. Used for SOS swipe guide arrows.

9. Holographic Shift: 6s ease-in-out infinite. Background-position shift creating shimmer effect on ID card.

10. Draw Ring: SVG stroke-dashoffset animation for the safety score ring progress.

### Reduced Motion
All animations disabled via @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce). Stagger children render at full opacity immediately. Gradient mesh becomes static at 20% opacity. SOS pulse becomes static glow.

---

## SECTION 10: DARK MODE SYSTEM

### Auto-Switch Logic
Default preference: "auto"
Storage key: "safeguard-theme-mode" in localStorage
Values: "light", "dark", "auto"
Auto behavior: Dark mode activates at 6 PM (hour >= 18), light mode at 6 AM (hour < 6)
Implementation: Class-based (.dark on html element)

### Dark Mode Adjustments

Base colors in dark mode:
- --color-background: hsl(222 47% 6%) — near-black slate
- --color-foreground: hsl(210 40% 98%) — near-white
- --color-card: hsl(222 47% 8%) — slightly lighter slate
- --color-muted: hsl(217 33% 17%) — medium slate
- --color-border: hsl(217 33% 17%)

Glass cards: bg-slate-800/70 with white/5 borders
Safety theme glows: Intensity increases from 15% to 25% in dark mode because colored glows are more visible against dark backgrounds and create beautiful halos
Map tiles: Switch from OpenStreetMap standard to CartoDB Dark Matter
Digital ID card: Premium black card finish (like Amex Centurion) instead of white
Leaflet popups and tooltips: Dark background (slate-950/92) with white/6 borders

### Dark Mode Detection
MutationObserver watches for class changes on document.documentElement to detect when .dark is toggled. This drives map tile URL switching and other dark-mode-dependent features.

## SECTION 11: SOS FLOATING BALL — Signature Feature

This is the most complex and most critical UI element in YatraX. It must be accessible from every page, always visible, and provide emergency SOS through intuitive touch gestures.

### Visual Design — Idle State

Shape: Perfect circle
Size: Dynamic based on theme — 48px (safe), 56px (caution), 64px (danger), calculated as calc(48px * var(--sos-scale))
Background: var(--theme-card-bg) — frosted glass
Backdrop-filter: blur(20px)
Border: 1px solid var(--theme-card-border)
Shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.08) plus animated glow shadow from sos-pulse keyframe
Icon: Siren icon from Lucide, centered
Opacity: 0.85 at rest
Z-index: 50 (above everything except toasts)
Position: fixed
Cursor: grab (grabbing when dragging)
Animation: sos-pulse at var(--sos-pulse-speed) ease-in-out infinite

### Positioning Rules

Snaps ONLY to left or right edge of viewport (never top/bottom edge)
Can move vertically anywhere within bounds
Respects safe areas (top and bottom) plus 80px for bottom tab navigation
Edge padding: 8px from viewport edge
Default position: Right edge, 40% from top of viewport
Position persisted in localStorage key "safeguard-sos-position"
Spring snap animation on release (200ms ease-out)

### Interaction State Machine

#### State 1: Idle (Default)
Subtle pulse animation. Semi-transparent at 85%. Siren icon visible. No guides showing. Draggable.

#### State 2: Dragging
Opacity increases to 1.0. Scale increases to 1.05. Cursor changes to grabbing. No SOS logic during drag. On release: calculates nearest horizontal edge and snaps with spring animation.

#### State 3: Long Press (300ms hold without movement)
Triggered after 300ms of holding without drag movement exceeding 10px.
Heavy haptic feedback fires.
Ball expands to 1.3x scale.
Background dims slightly (overlay at 20% black opacity).
Guide arrows appear showing valid swipe directions:
- If ball is on RIGHT edge: show left arrow, up arrow, down arrow
- If ball is on LEFT edge: show right arrow, up arrow, down arrow
Text label appears below ball: "Swipe to trigger SOS"
Guide arrows animate with directional bounce (1s infinite loop).

#### State 4: Silent Pre-Alert (2-second hold without swiping)
If user holds for 2 full seconds without swiping while in long-press state:
POST /api/sos/pre-alert to backend silently.
Very subtle glow intensification (barely noticeable — user should NOT realize this happened).
No toast, no notification, no UI change.
Backend monitors the pre-alert and watches for escalation.
Purpose: If the tourist is scared or uncertain, the backend already knows something might be wrong.

#### State 5: Valid Swipe Detected — Countdown
Valid swipe conditions (ALL must be true):
- Long press state is active (after 300ms hold)
- Swipe distance >= 80px
- Horizontal swipe direction is TOWARD center of screen (right ball swipes left, left ball swipes right)
- Vertical swipes (up or down) are always valid regardless of ball side

When valid swipe detected:
Full-screen glassmorphism overlay appears (200ms fade-in).
Large morphing countdown number in center: 3, 2, 1.
Each number uses countdown-pop animation (400ms).
Heavy haptic on each tick.
Background pulses red, intensifying with each tick.
Prominent text: "TAP ANYWHERE TO CANCEL" pulsing below countdown.
If user taps anywhere: cancel, overlay fades out (200ms), ball returns to idle, light haptic.
If countdown completes without cancellation: SOS fires.

#### State 6: SOS Fired
POST /api/sos/trigger with: touristId, lat, lng, accuracy, timestamp, type "FULL_SOS", reverse-geocoded address, nearest station name and ETA.
Full-screen takeover replaces countdown:
- Large checkmark icon in emerald
- "SOS Sent" heading
- "Help is on the way" subtitle
- Emergency call button (tel:112) — large, prominent
- "Nearest police notified" with station name and ETA
- "I'm Safe Now" dismiss button (appears after 10 seconds, requires confirmation tap)
Heavy haptic success pattern.
Ball temporarily turns emerald, stops pulsing.

### Three-Tier Alert System
Tier 1 — Pre-Alert (Silent): 2-second hold, POST pre-alert, backend monitors, no dispatch, user not notified
Tier 2 — Full SOS (Dispatched): Swipe + countdown completes, POST trigger, emergency services dispatched, tourist profile shared with responders
Tier 3 — Offline SOS (Queued): No network detected, saved to localStorage queue, service worker background sync sends when restored, success screen shows "SOS saved. Will send when connection restored." with emergency call still available via tel: link

### Gesture Handler — Pure Functions
All gesture logic lives in pure functions (no React, no side effects) for testability:
- detectSwipeDirection(startX, startY, endX, endY, ballSide): returns 'horizontal' or 'vertical' or 'invalid'
- isValidSOSTrigger(longPressActive, swipeDirection, swipeDistance): returns boolean
- calculateSnapPosition(currentX, currentY, viewportWidth, viewportHeight, safeArea): returns {x, y, side}

- "Loading Map" text-sm font-semibold
- "Fetching safety data..." text-xs text-muted-foreground

### Feature 18: Geofence Alert System
Runs on every GPS position update from watchPosition.

Logic:
- Maintain a Set of zone IDs the user is currently inside (prevZonesRef)
- On each position update, calculate distance from user to each zone center
- If distance <= zone.radiusMeters, add zone ID to current set
- Compare current set with previous set:
  - Zone ID in current but NOT in previous = ENTERED zone
    - Heavy haptic feedback
    - Toast warning: "Entered risk zone: {name}" with description "{level} risk — Stay alert", duration 5000ms
  - Zone ID in previous but NOT in current = LEFT zone
    - Light haptic feedback  
    - Toast success: "You've left the risk zone", duration 3000ms
- Update previous set to current set

### Feature 19: Continuous GPS Tracking
Uses navigator.geolocation.watchPosition instead of one-shot getCurrentPosition.
Options: enableHighAccuracy true, maximumAge 5000ms (accept 5-second-old position), timeout 15000ms

Updates on each position callback:
- userPosition state
- accuracy state (pos.coords.accuracy)
- heading state (pos.coords.heading, may be null)
- speed state (pos.coords.speed, may be null)

Throttled backend post: Every 15 seconds maximum, POST location to /api/tourist/{id}/location with lat, lng. Uses Date.now() comparison with last post timestamp.

Cleanup: clearWatch on component unmount via useEffect return.

### Feature 20: Dark Mode Detection for Map
MutationObserver watches document.documentElement for class attribute changes.
When .dark class is added or removed, isDarkMode state updates.
This drives tile URL selection between OpenStreetMap and CartoDB Dark Matter.

### Safe Route Algorithm (Current Implementation)

Step 1 — Generate 3 alternative routes:
Since Google Directions API is not yet integrated, routes are generated locally:
- Direct route: 30 interpolated points between start and end
- North variant: 15 points from start to midpoint offset north, then 15 points to end
- South variant: 15 points from start to midpoint offset south, then 15 points to end
- Offset magnitude: 15% of the greater of latitude or longitude delta

Step 2 — Score each route:
For each point on each route:
- Calculate distance to every risk zone center
- If point is inside zone (distance <= radius): increment counter for that zone's risk level
- Calculate distance to every police station
- If station is within 500m: increment police counter

Score formula:
```
score = 100
      - (highRiskIntersections × 30)
      - (mediumRiskIntersections × 15)
      - (lowRiskIntersections × 5)
      + (policeNearby × 10)
Clamped to [0, 100]
```

Step 3 — Calculate distance and duration:
- Distance: sum of Leaflet distanceTo between consecutive points
- Duration: distance / walking speed (1.39 m/s = 5 km/h)

Step 4 — Rank:
- Highest safety score: isSafest = true
- Shortest distance: isFastest = true
- (May be same route for both)

Future: Replace route generation with Google Directions API returning real road polylines with alternatives:true. Decode encoded polylines to lat/lng arrays. Apply same scoring algorithm to real road points.

### Distance and ETA Utilities

formatDistance(meters):
- Under 1000m: "{rounded}m" (e.g., "650m")
- 1000m and above: "{km.toFixed(1)}km" (e.g., "1.2km")

formatETA(meters, mode):
- Walking: 5 km/h
- Driving: 30 km/h

- **SOS trigger frequency** (Backend | Both) - Real panic indicators.
- **Pre-alert frequency** (Backend | Both) - Uneasiness proxy (2-sec holds).
- **Nearby tourist density** (App tracking | Both) - Herd safety.
- **Predicted score** (Forecasting | Both) - 1/3/6 hours into the future.

#### Category 16: External Intelligence (6 factors, Medium Feasibility)
- **Government travel advisories** (MEA/Foreign Ministries | Both) - Official warnings.
- **NDMA disaster alerts** (API | Both) - Active tectonic/meteorological events.
- **Local news sentiment** (NLP | Both) - Current events processing.
- **Social media risk signals** (Twitter API | Both) - Crowd-sourced spontaneous issues.
- **Community safety reports** (App users | Both) - Waze-style hazard tagging.
- **Similar event global incidents** (Global databases | Both) - Emerging trend correlation.

### 17b. Environment Detection
Factor weights change drastically based on context.
- **Urban**: City density, services, high crime metrics.
- **Suburban**: Moderate density.
- **Rural**: Agriculture, sparse layout.
- **Remote**: Few services, bad connectivity, >5km from settlements.
- **Wilderness**: 0 places, no network, >10km from settlements.

*Weight Distribution changes*:
- **Urban**: Crime + Services + Time dominate (Time: 10%, Police: 12%, Crime: 12%)
- **Wilderness**: Infrastructure + Weather + Survival dominate (Time: 15%, Daylight: 18%, Connect: 18%, Health: 18%)

### 17c. Phase 1 Implementation (Current)
Pure rule-based heuristics utilizing Google Maps APIs, device APIs, and basic backend checks. A weighted score out of 100 determines the theme state (`safe`, `caution`, `danger`).

**15 Active Factors (Phase 1):**
1. **Time of day (10%)**: Device clock. 8am-6pm (95), Late Night 2am-5am (10).
2. **Day of week (3%)**: Weekend night penalty.
3. **Season (5%)**: Monsoon penalty (Assam).
4. **Daylight (5%)**: After sunset drastically lowers score.
5. **Risk Zone (12%)**: Polygon intersections. Score hard-capped based on zone severity.
6. **Police ETA (10%)**: Google Distance Matrix API.
7. **Hospital ETA (8%)**: Google Distance Matrix API.
8. **Area density (8%)**: Google Places nearby search count.
9. **Area place types (7%)**: Safe vs Risky place clustering.
10. **Open businesses (5%)**: `openNow` proxy for crowds.
11. **Active alerts (8%)**: Backend WebSocket alerts count.
12. **Historical incidents (7%)**: Backend past 30 days.
13. **Connectivity (4%)**: `navigator.connection` API.
14. **Weather (5%)**: OpenWeather API.
15. **Air Quality (3%)**: Google Air Quality API.

**Hard Caps**:
- High Risk Zone: `score <= 40`
- Medium Risk Zone: `score <= 65`
- >5 Active Alerts: `score <= 30`
- Zero Network: `score <= 50`

### 17d. Predictive Capabilities (Future)
The ML pipeline will generate forecasts indicating shifting states before they happen.
Outputs include:
- Current Assessment: Score + Primary driving factor.
- Predictions: Forecasted score at `+1h`, `+3h`, `+6h`.
- Reasoning: "Sun will set, temperatures drop, no connectivity".
- Recommendations: Actionable NL prompts comparing alternative actions (Stay vs Leave).

### 17e. Data Source Inventory
- **Free**: OSM, IMD, CWC, NDMA, NCRB, Census, NASA FIRMS, VIIRS, SRTM, GSI, NVBDCP, TRAI, Browser APIs.
- **Paid (Google Maps)**: Places, Directions, Distance Matrix, Geocoding, Air Quality.
- **Internal (Backend)**: Risk Zones, Police DB, Hospital DB, SOS/Pre-Alert Analytics, Incident Hist.
- **Future**: CCTV ML parsing, Ride-hailing APIs, Cell-tower density, Local IoT.

## SECTION 18: GOOGLE MAPS API INTEGRATION

### Caching Strategy

| Data Type | Cache Duration | Refresh Trigger |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Places nearby | 15 minutes | 500m movement |
| Distance Matrix | 5 minutes | 500m movement |
| Reverse Geocode | 1 hour | 500m movement |
| Air Quality | 1 hour | 2km movement |
| Directions | 5 minutes | New destination |
| Place Details | 24 hours | Explicit request |

Cache implementation: In-memory Map with TTL, backed by localStorage for cross-session persistence. Key format includes location hash for distance-based invalidation.

### Area Safety Profiling via Places
Positive signals (increase score): police stations, hospitals, hotels, malls, restaurants, tourist attractions
Negative signals (decrease score): bars at night, very few places (isolation), adult entertainment
Crowd proxy: Count of open businesses, sum of review counts as traffic estimation
Emergency response: Real travel time via Distance Matrix API

## SECTION 19: BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE & DATA MODELS

### Architecture Overview
The backend is a Node.js + Express.js REST API using MongoDB as the primary database via Mongoose ORM. It currently lacks advanced security infrastructure like rate-limiting, bcrypt hashing, or containerized DevOps (no Docker/CI). 

### Directory Structure (`backend-node/src/`)
- `config/`: Database connection (`mongoStore.ts`), CORS options, and env parsing.
- `controllers/`: Request handlers mapping to specific domains (e.g., `authController.ts`, `alertController.ts`).
- `middleware/`: Custom `requestLogger.ts` and `errorHandler.ts`. Basic `authMiddleware` exists but is inconsistently applied.
- `models/`: Mongoose model initializations (e.g., `Tourist.ts`, `Alert.ts`).
- `routes/`: Express routers aggregating controllers (e.g., `api/auth`, `api/sos`).
- `schemas/`: Mongoose schema definitions and TypeScript interfaces.
- `services/`: Business logic and external connections (e.g., `websocketHub.ts`).

### Mongoose Schemas (Data Models)
The system uses standard 2D indexes (`[lat, lng]`) for location queries, not PostGIS.

#### 1. Tourist (`Tourist.schema.ts`)
Core user profile and location tracking entity.
- **Fields**: `_id`, `name`, `email` (unique), `phone`, `passportNumber`, `passwordHash` (stored raw/basic hash), `safetyScore` (default 100), `currentLat`, `currentLng`, `lastSeen`.
- **References**: Profile info (`dateOfBirth`, `address`, `gender`, `emergencyContact`, `idHash`).
- **Indexes**: Compound index on `{ currentLat: 1, currentLng: 1 }`.

#### 2. RiskZone (`RiskZone.schema.ts`)
Geospatial hazard areas defined by admins.
- **Fields**: `zoneId` (unique), `name`, `description`, `centerLat`, `centerLng`, `radiusMeters`, `riskLevel` (enum: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), `active` (boolean).
- **Indexes**: Compound index on `{ centerLat: 1, centerLng: 1 }`, and `{ active: 1 }`.

#### 3. Alert (`Alert.schema.ts`)
SOS triggers, warnings, and system notifications.
- **Fields**: `alertId` (unique), `touristId` (refs Tourist), `alertType`, `priority` (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL), `status` (OPEN/ACKNOWLEDGED/RESOLVED/DISMISSED), `latitude`, `longitude`.
- **Indexes**: `{ status: 1 }`, `{ createdAt: -1 }`.

#### 4. PoliceDepartment & Hospital
Static infrastructure entities.
- **Police**: `name`, `departmentCode`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `contactNumber`, `type` (outpost/station/district_hq).
- **Hospital**: `name`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `contactNumber`, `emergency` (boolean), `level` (PHC/CHC/DH/Medical College).

### WebSocket Implementation
- **Hub (`websocketHub.ts`)**: A simple `WebSocketServer` imported from `ws`.
- **Pattern**: Basic broadcast model to `/topic/alerts`. 
- **Limitations**: Currently no advanced room clustering (e.g., grouping users by physical distance to an alert) or namespace management.

## SECTION 21: CSS ARCHITECTURE (index.css — Complete Specification)

The index.css file is the foundation of the entire visual system. It must contain all of the following sections in order.

### Section 1: Tailwind Import
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

### Section 2: @theme Block (Tailwind v4 Format)
Contains all shadcn color tokens, custom animation definitions, and radius values.

Color tokens include: background, foreground, card, card-foreground, popover, popover-foreground, primary, primary-foreground, secondary, secondary-foreground, muted, muted-foreground, accent, accent-foreground, destructive, destructive-foreground, border, input, ring.

Animation definitions in @theme block:
- --animate-mesh-drift-1: mesh-drift-1 60s ease-in-out infinite
- --animate-mesh-drift-2: mesh-drift-2 55s ease-in-out infinite
- --animate-mesh-drift-3: mesh-drift-3 65s ease-in-out infinite
- --animate-mesh-drift-4: mesh-drift-4 50s ease-in-out infinite
- --animate-sos-pulse: sos-pulse var(--sos-pulse-speed, 3s) ease-in-out infinite
- --animate-countdown-pop: countdown-pop 0.4s ease-out
- --animate-scale-in: scale-in 0.3s ease-out
- --animate-bounce-left: bounce-left 1s ease-in-out infinite
- --animate-bounce-right: bounce-right 1s ease-in-out infinite
- --animate-bounce-up: bounce-up 1s ease-in-out infinite
- --animate-bounce-down: bounce-down 1s ease-in-out infinite
- --animate-holo-shift: holo-shift 6s ease-in-out infinite
- --animate-draw-ring: draw-ring 1s ease-out forwards

Radius: --radius: 1rem

### Section 3: @property Declarations
Every animatable CSS custom property must have an @property declaration for smooth browser interpolation:

```css
@property --theme-bg-from { syntax: '<color>'; initial-value: oklch(0.97 0.03 160); inherits: true; }
@property --theme-bg-to { syntax: '<color>'; initial-value: oklch(0.97 0.02 180); inherits: true; }
@property --theme-primary { syntax: '<color>'; initial-value: oklch(0.65 0.17 160); inherits: true; }
@property --theme-primary-foreground { syntax: '<color>'; initial-value: oklch(0.99 0 0); inherits: true; }
@property --theme-glow { syntax: '<color>'; initial-value: oklch(0.65 0.17 160 / 0.15); inherits: true; }
@property --theme-card-bg { syntax: '<color>'; initial-value: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.70); inherits: true; }
@property --theme-card-border { syntax: '<color>'; initial-value: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.15); inherits: true; }
@property --sos-scale { syntax: '<number>'; initial-value: 1; inherits: true; }
@property --sos-pulse-speed { syntax: '<time>'; initial-value: 3s; inherits: true; }
```

### Section 4: :root Variables
All CSS custom properties with default values (safe theme). Includes theme variables, zone colors, route colors, SOS variables, holographic variables.

CRITICAL: The transition declaration on :root uses SPECIFIC property names, NOT "transition: all 2s":
```css
:root {
  --theme-bg-from: oklch(0.97 0.03 160);
  --theme-bg-to: oklch(0.97 0.02 180);
  --theme-primary: oklch(0.65 0.17 160);
  --theme-primary-foreground: oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --theme-glow: oklch(0.65 0.17 160 / 0.15);
  --theme-card-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.70);
  --theme-card-border: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.15);
  --sos-scale: 1;
  --sos-pulse-speed: 3s;
  
  --zone-high: #dc2626;
  --zone-medium: #ea580c;
  --zone-low: #ca8a04;
  
  --route-safest: #10b981;
  --route-fastest: #3b82f6;
  --route-alt: #94a3b8;

  transition-property: --theme-bg-from, --theme-bg-to, --theme-primary,
                       --theme-primary-foreground, --theme-glow,
                       --theme-card-bg, --theme-card-border,
                       --sos-scale, --sos-pulse-speed;
  transition-duration: 2s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}
```

## SECTION 22: OFFLINE STRATEGY

### Must Work Offline (Critical Features)
- SOS trigger: Queued to localStorage, service worker background sync sends when restored
- Emergency tel: links: Always functional (native phone capability)
- Digital ID: Cached in localStorage, viewable without network
- Last safety score: Cached, displayed with "Last updated {time}" notice
- Emergency contacts strip: Static data, always rendered

### Can Degrade Gracefully
- Map: Cached tiles show, new tiles show gray. "Offline" banner shown.
- Search: Shows "Search unavailable offline" message
- Alerts: Show cached alerts with notice "May not be current"
- Location sharing: Queue location updates, sync when restored
- Settings: Changes saved locally, synced to backend when restored
- Safety score: Show last cached score with stale indicator

### Offline SOS Queue
```typescript
interface OfflineSOS {
  id: string;
  touristId: string;
  lat: number;
  lng: number;
  accuracy?: number;
  timestamp: number;
  status: 'queued' | 'sending' | 'sent' | 'failed';
}
```

Stored in localStorage under key "sos-offline-queue" as JSON array.
Service worker registers sync event tag "sync-sos".
On sync event: reads queue, attempts to POST each, removes successful entries, retries failed on next sync.

Offline SOS success screen shows modified message:
- "SOS Saved" instead of "SOS Sent"
- "Will send when connection restored" subtitle
- Emergency call button still available (tel: works offline)
- "I'm Safe" dismiss still works (clears from queue)

### Network Detection
```typescript
// In hooks and providers
const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(navigator.onLine);

useEffect(() => {
  const handleOnline = () => { setIsOnline(true); toast.success("Back online"); };
  const handleOffline = () => { setIsOnline(false); toast.warning("You're offline"); };
  window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
  window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
  };
}, []);
```

## SECTION 23: CODING RULES (ENFORCED — NO EXCEPTIONS)

1. MODULARITY: Every component in its own file. No file exceeds 150 lines. If it does, extract sub-components.

2. HOOKS FOR LOGIC: All data fetching, state management, effects, and business logic live in custom hooks. Components only render JSX.

3. PURE FUNCTIONS: Gesture calculations, theme computation, formatting, scoring — all pure functions with no side effects, easily testable.

4. TYPE SAFETY: Every prop, state variable, function parameter, and return value is explicitly typed. No 'any' type anywhere.

5. SHADCN FIRST: Use shadcn/ui components as base for all UI elements. Do not build buttons, inputs, dialogs, sheets, badges, cards, or other standard components from scratch.

6. CSS VARIABLES: Never hardcode colors for theme-dependent elements. Always reference CSS custom properties (--theme-*, --color-*) so the dynamic theme system works.

7. PERFORMANCE: React.memo for list items and repeated components. useCallback for functions passed as props. useMemo for expensive computed values. CSS animations over JS animations. Avoid unnecessary re-renders.

8. ACCESSIBILITY: aria-labels on all interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs). Color is never the ONLY indicator of state (always paired with text/icon). 44px minimum touch targets everywhere. Focus management in modals and sheets.

9. MOBILE-FIRST: active: states over hover: states (hover doesn't exist on mobile). Safe area support. Touch-optimized interactions. No reliance on right-click or hover tooltips for critical functionality.

10. NO DEAD CODE: No commented-out blocks. No unused imports. No TODO comments. No placeholder functions that do nothing. Every line serves a purpose.

11. COMPOSITION ROOTS: Page files (Home.tsx, Map.tsx, Identity.tsx, Settings.tsx) are SHORT composition-only files. Maximum 40-60 lines. They import sub-components and hooks, compose them, and return JSX. Zero business logic.

12. ERROR HANDLING: No silent catch{} blocks. Every error is either shown to the user via toast notification, logged for debugging, or handled with a fallback state. API calls have retry logic, timeout handling, and user-visible error messages.

---

## SECTION 24: KEY DESIGN DECISIONS ALREADY MADE

These decisions are FINAL and should not be revisited:

1. SOS is a GLOBAL floating ball, not a page-specific button. There is NO SOS button on the map page or any other page.
2. Safety score is the HERO element of the home page — largest visual, top of content.
3. Emergency contacts are ALWAYS visible as a horizontal strip, never collapsible or hidden.
4. Alerts are compact LIST ROWS with colored dots, not full-width cards.
5. Daily tip is STATIC (random on mount per day), not rotating or auto-advancing.
6. Map uses Leaflet for rendering, Google for data (hybrid approach).
7. Safe route scoring uses zone intersection analysis with weighted penalties and police bonuses.
8. Theme transitions are exactly 2 seconds with smooth oklch color interpolation.
9. Dark mode auto-switches at 6 PM (dark) and 6 AM (light) in auto mode.
10. Nearest station/hospital shows real calculated travel TIME and distance, not straight-line approximation.
11. No weather widget on home page — weather data feeds into the safety score silently.
12. Score factors are shown as horizontal scrollable pills with trend arrows.
13. Pages are composition roots: maximum 40-60 lines, zero logic.
14. All previously commented-out code has been removed.
15. All hardcoded user data has been replaced with session data from context.
16. Glass card hierarchy is enforced (Level 1 for heroes, Level 2 for actions, Level 3 for info).
17. Map has no local SOS button — the global floating SOS ball is always accessible.
18. Map controls are merged into a single right-side column (compass, zoom in, zoom out, locate).
19. Factor pills use trend icons (arrows up/down/right) not color alone.
20. The gradient mesh background is pure CSS (no JavaScript animation frames).

## SECTION 26: CURRENT PROJECT STATE

### What Exists (Production-Quality)
- UserLayout with tab navigation, SOS ball integration, and ThemeProvider
- Home page (composition root, 45 lines, all sub-components, pull-to-refresh, WebSocket real-time alerts)
- Map page (composition root, ~70 lines, all 20 features, MapView + MapOverlays extracted)
- Identity page (card flip animation, QR code, holographic shimmer, extracted skeleton)
- Settings page (12 components: header, theme selector, notifications, privacy, emergency, about, danger zone, language selector, skeleton)
- SOS floating ball system (6 states, gesture handler, confirm overlay, success screen)
- Dynamic theme engine (score-driven oklch transitions, auto dark mode at 6PM/6AM)
- Glassmorphism card system (glass-1, glass-2, glass-3 via GlassCard component)
- Modular API layer (lib/api/ with client, types, tourist, public, admin, websocket modules)
- Modular store (lib/store/ with app-state, haptics, backward-compat barrel)
- Utility libraries (lib/utils/ with format, geo, storage)
- Gradient mesh background component
- Animated number component
- Error boundary with retry fallback UI
- Global offline banner component
- Admin console (29 files: dashboard, alerts, tourists, risk zones, police management)
- Dual auth system (tourist login/register + admin login with JWT tokens)
- Pull-to-refresh component

### What Needs Building
- Google Maps API integration (lib/api/google/ — places, directions, distance-matrix, geocoding, air-quality, caching)
- Phase 1 safety score calculator (lib/safety/ — client-side rule-based with 15 factors)
- Service worker for offline capabilities (SOS queue, push notifications, cache strategies)
- Fallback data files (data/assam-restricted-areas.json, data/assam-police-stations.json)
- Animation system utilities (lib/animations/ — variants, transitions, stagger helpers)
- Page transition wrapper (components/shared/page-transition.tsx)
- Session refactor to React Context pattern (currently useSyncExternalStore)
- Admin panel architecture refactor (index.tsx at 413 lines, needs composition root pattern)
- Route guards / middleware for admin auth (currently inline in AdminPanel)

---

## SECTION 27: AUTHENTICATION & SESSION MANAGEMENT

### Tourist Auth Flow
1. User opens Settings tab → sees AuthView (login/register form)
2. Registration: POST /api/auth/register → receives { touristId, token, user, qr_content }
3. Login: POST /api/auth/login → receives { touristId, token, user, qr_content }
4. Session stored in localStorage via `setSession()` from lib/session.ts
5. Session accessed app-wide via `useSession()` hook (useSyncExternalStore pattern)
6. Logout: `clearSession()` removes localStorage keys

### Admin Auth Flow
1. Admin navigates to /admin → App.tsx renders AdminLayout
2. AdminLayout uses `useAdminSession()` for header/nav state
3. AdminPanel checks `localStorage.getItem("adminToken")` for auth state
4. If not authenticated → renders LoginScreen component
5. Login: POST /api/admin/login → stores token in localStorage, sets admin session
6. Logout: `clearAdminSession()` removes localStorage keys

### Session Types

**Tourist Session** (lib/session.ts):
- touristId, name, email, token
- Stored as `safarsathi_session` in localStorage
- Reactive via useSyncExternalStore with listeners

**Admin Session** (lib/session.ts):
- adminId, name, email, departmentCode, city, district, state
- Stored as `safarsathi_admin_session` in localStorage
- Reactive via useSyncExternalStore with listeners

### Known Issues
- No JWT refresh mechanism — tokens persist until manual logout
- No token expiry validation on client side
- Admin auth is duplicated: AdminPanel checks localStorage directly AND uses useAdminSession()
- No route-level auth guards — auth is checked inline in components

---

## SECTION 28: ADMIN CONSOLE ARCHITECTURE

### Layout
AdminLayout.tsx renders:
- Top header bar with SafarSathi branding, nav tabs, search, live status indicator, user dropdown
- Mobile-responsive: horizontal scrolling nav on small screens
- Renders AdminPanel as main content area

### Admin Sections (5 tabs)

| Tab | Component | Features |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| Dashboard | DashboardSection | Stats overview, recent alerts, activity feed, quick actions |
| Alerts | AlertsSection | Filterable alert table, bulk resolve, individual resolve |
| Tourists | TouristsSection | Tourist list with risk levels, contact, track on map |
| Risk Zones | ZonesSection | Interactive map for zone CRUD, click-to-place zones |
| Police Units | PoliceSection | Police department management with CRUD |

### Data Flow
```
useAdminData(isAuthenticated)
  → fetches: dashboard, alerts, tourists, risk zones, police
  → normalizes: API responses → typed AdminData
  → returns: { data, refreshing, refetch }

useAlertActions(refetch): resolve, bulkResolve
useZoneActions(refetch): save, delete
usePoliceActions(refetch): save, delete
useFilteredData(data, ...filters): computed filtered views
useQuickStats(data): derived statistics
```

### Known Issues
- AdminPanel index.tsx is 413 lines — should be a composition root ≤60 lines
- Hardcoded API_BASE in index.tsx (`http://localhost:8081/api`) duplicates lib/api/client.ts
- Login uses raw fetch instead of lib/api/admin.ts `adminLogin()` function
- 15+ useState calls in AdminPanel — should be extracted to a dedicated hook
- Dialog state management is verbose — consider a reducer or dialog manager

---

## SECTION 29: ROUTING & ROLE-BASED ACCESS

### Current Routing (App.tsx)
Manual pathname-based routing using `window.location.pathname`:
```
/ → UserLayout (contains Home, Map, ID, Settings tabs)
/admin → AdminLayout → AdminPanel
```

No React Router — uses `popstate` event listener and conditional rendering.

### Role Detection
- Tourist: Any user on `/` path. Auth is optional (unauthenticated users see limited UI).
- Admin: Any user on `/admin` path. Auth required — LoginScreen shown if no token.
- No explicit role field — admin vs tourist determined purely by navigation path.

### Known Issues
- No client-side route protection — admin page is accessible to anyone who navigates to /admin
- No 404 handling — unknown paths render nothing
- No deep linking support within tabs
- Switching between /admin and / requires full page reload
